# ezFishing

This is an addon for the MMORPG World of WarCraft.

## Description

ezFishing is an addon to add a few quality-of-life features to the Fishing profession. It enables players to quickly apply a fishing lure to their rod, it will enable autoloot, and it will modify the in-game sound properties so that it is easy to hear the "bobber" effect.

It has options for all of the above which can be accessed by typing '/ezfishing' or '/ezfish' in the chat window or through the Interface > AddOn panel.
